## Dungeon Chef

### Overview

Dungeon Chef is a game made for the [Miz Jam 1](https://itch.io/jam/miz-jam-1) using the [Kenney 1-Bit Pack](https://kenney.nl/assets/bit-pack) for visuals.

The goal of the jam was to have many developers use the same art assets in many different variations.

### My Experience
This is the first game I've "completed" and released publicly, though I don't think I've achieved my full vision for this small project.

I have worked with Unity in the past but recently began working with the Godot game engine prior to beginning this project. As a result, this code is not representative of good Godot principals but rather is my attempt to jump into a new engine and learn something new.

As such I have made the source code available under GPL 3.0 but do not recommend making use of any of it.

The game is available for play in browser, or for download on Mac [on my itch.io page](https://jordones.itch.io/dungeon-chef)

### Design Document
I've also maintained a rough document with some design decisions [here](https://github.com/jordones/dungeon_chef/blob/master/game_design.md).
